## Ask Emily Prototype Scope Document

### Objective
The objective of this prototype is to demonstrate a basic understanding of the "Ask Emily" AI Trip Planner system. The focus will be on creating a basic workflow showcasing the AI recommendation system and its integration with essential components like GPS and an RV Technician Finder, leveraging existing APIs and pre-trained models.

### Key Features for the Prototype

1. **User Interface (UI):** 
   - Develop a simple and intuitive web interface using basic HTML/CSS.
   - Showcase key screens for trip planning, RV Technician Finder, and GPS navigation.

2. **AI Recommendation System:**
   - Leverage a pre-trained language model (e.g., GPT-3) to simulate personalized trip recommendations.
   - Provide sample responses that illustrate how user preferences are taken into account.

3. **GPS Integration:**
   - Integrate Google Maps API to demonstrate basic routing capabilities.
   - Use mock data to simulate a route suggestion for RVs.

4. **RV Technician Finder:**
   - Create a simple interface allowing users to input location and view available RV technicians using mock data.
   - Demonstrate a Taskrabbit-esque functionality using API integration concepts.

5. **Mock Data and Sample Scenarios:**
   - Utilize mock data to illustrate how the system processes user inputs and provides outputs.
   - Develop example scenarios to reflect possible user interactions and system responses.

### Assumptions
- The prototype will use available online resources and pre-trained models; custom model training is not within the scope.
- The focus will be on functionality demonstration rather than full backend integration.

### Deliverables
- A functional prototype illustrating key features within the defined scope.
- A brief presentation summarizing the approach, key features, and next steps for further development.

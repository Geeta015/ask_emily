Creating a basic workflow involves defining the essential components of the "Ask Emily" system and illustrating how they interact to deliver the desired functionalities. This will help you outline the user journey and the internal processes that drive the system. Here's a basic workflow covering the core components:
### Workflow Overview for "Ask Emily":
1. **User Interface and Interaction:**
   - **Step 1:** User accesses the "Ask Emily" platform through a web or mobile interface.
   - **Step 2:** User inputs travel preferences, such as trip origin, destination, RV type, and desired amenities.

2. **Data Collection and Analysis:**
   - **Step 3:** System collects input data and retrieves additional data from external sources:
     - **Campground Information:** Integrate with campground APIs to fetch availability, amenities, and user reviews.
     - **Strategic Partnerships:** Use APIs or partner databases to show available discounts and offers.

3. **AI-driven Recommendation Engine:**
   - **Step 4:** The engine processes the user input and external data:
     - **Personalized Itinerary Creation:** The AI system uses pre-trained models to generate customized trip plans and suggest suitable campgrounds based on user preferences.
     - **Offers and Discounts:** Dynamically integrate available partner offers into the itinerary.

4. **GPS and Navigation Support:**
   - **Step 5:** User obtains route suggestions tailored to their RV specifications using GPS APIs (Google Maps):
     - **Custom Routing:** Takes into account user-specific requirements like bridge heights, road restrictions, and fuel stations with diesel options.

5. **RV Technician Finder:**
   - **Step 6:** If needed, users search for RV technicians:
     - **Location-Based Technician Search:** Utilize RVTAA data to locate technicians around the user's travel route or destination.
     - **Taskrabbit-like Interaction:** Users can view profiles, prices, and contact technicians easily.

6. **Feedback and Adaptation:**
   - **Step 7:** Users provide feedback on trip recommendations, which the system uses to refine future suggestions:
     - **User Feedback Integration:** Gather user ratings and reviews for continuous improvement of recommendations.

### Diagram Representation

Although I can't draw a diagram here, you can visualize the workflow as a flowchart:
